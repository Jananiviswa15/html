	<p> PHP is              an open-source programming language created in 1990. Many web developers find it essential to learn PHP, as this language is used to build more than 80% of websites 
	on the In

	In the same way that the mindless diamond keeps
one spark of the planet's early fires
				trapped forever in its net of ice,
it's not love's later heat that poetry holds,
but the atom of the love that drew it forth
from the silence: so if the bright coal of his love
begins to smoulder, the poet hears his voice
suddenly forced, like a bar-room singer'sâ€”boastful
with his own huge feeling, or drowned by violins;
but if it yields a steadier light, he knows
the pure verse, when it finally comes, will sound
like a mountain spring, anonymous and serene.
